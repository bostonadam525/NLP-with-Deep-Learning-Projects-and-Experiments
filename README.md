# NLP-with-Deep-Learning-Projects-and-Experiments
* By Adam Lang - A repo with all of my NLP with deep learning projects and experiments.

## Overview
* RNNs (Recurrent Neural Network), LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory), GRUs (Gated Recurrent Unit), CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), and Transformers are all well known types of neural networks designed to handle sequential text data.
* They do however differ in their architecture and capabilities:

* CNNs are usually used for image classification tasks, but instead of pixels, we input sentences or documents represented as a matrix of words.

## Contents
* I will use this repo to demo various deep learning use cases, projects, experiments, case studies, and architectures for NLP.
