# TensorFlow Projects and Experiments
* A repo dedicated to all things TensorFlow projects, techniques, and experiments.

# Important Considerations for this repo
* As the great Kobe Bryant once said:
```
Mamba Mentality means "to constantly try to be the best version of yourself. It's a constant quest to try to better today than you were yesterday."
“Why do you think I’m the best player in the world? Because I never ever get bored with the basics.”
```
```
We should all remember that. It never hurts to go forwards and backwards whether its "back to basics" or fast forward to the most complicated neural network code you can imagine.
```

* Thus you will find "all things TensorFlow" in this repo to help with practice, design, and implementation of various ideas and concepts.
* It's also important to remember that modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are built on the backbone of Neural Networks.
    * Think of neural networks as Kobe said "I never get bored with the basics", well that's what neural networks are, the basics.
    * If you don't understand neural networks inside and out I don't care if you are a PhD or not, neural networks are what drive modern NLP and LLM infrastructure and new ideas and algorithms stem from us experimenting with the basics to the very advanced and everywhere in between!
