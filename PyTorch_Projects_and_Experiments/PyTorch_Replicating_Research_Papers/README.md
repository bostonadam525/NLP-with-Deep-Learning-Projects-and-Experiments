# PyTorch - Replicating Research Papers
* This repo was inspired by Daniel Bourke's PyTorch Deep Learning Bootcamp. It contains some resources from Daniel's research/documentation but I have also added additional resources inspired by his.


# Sections of a Machine Learning Research Paper
* See Daniel Bourke's excellent review of this [here](https://www.learnpytorch.io/08_pytorch_paper_replicating/)
