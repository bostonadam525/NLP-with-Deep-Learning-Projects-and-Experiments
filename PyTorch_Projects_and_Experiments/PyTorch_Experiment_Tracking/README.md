# PyTorch Experiment Tracking
* This repo has the foundations of experiment tracking when using PyTorch and other machine learning libraries. 
* Some of the code and notebooks are a review and inspired by the great Daniel Bourke and his PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp.
* Some of the code and notebooks are ideas and experiments that I came up with.
* Some are utility scripts that anyone can use for deep learning projects.

# Experiment Tracking
* We always want to track our models whether in dev or prod throughout the lifecycle.

## Various wasy to track machine learning experiments
1. Files (e.g. CSV, JSON, etc.)
2. Data structures in Python (e.g. dictionaries, lists, arrays, dataframes, etc..)
3. Tensorboard - [tensorboard homepage](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)
4. Weights & Biases - [W&B homepage](https://wandb.ai/site/)
5. MLflow - [Mlflow github](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow)
