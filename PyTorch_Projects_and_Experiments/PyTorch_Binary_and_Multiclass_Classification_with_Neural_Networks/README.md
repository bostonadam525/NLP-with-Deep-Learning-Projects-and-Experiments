# PyTorch Binary and Multiclass Classification with Neural Networks
* This repo has the ins and outs of binary and multiclass classification using PyTorch. 
* Some of the code and notebooks are a review and inspired by the great Daniel Bourke and his PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp. Special Thank you to Mr. Daniel Bourke he is a genious when it comes to teaching PyTorch.
* Some of the code and notebooks are ideas and experiments that I came up with.
* Some are utility scripts that anyone can use for deep learning projects.
