# Pytorch Foundations
* This repo has the foundations of PyTorch.
  * Some of the code and notebooks are a review and inspired by the great Daniel Bourke and his PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp.
  * Some of the code and notebooks are ideas and experiments that I came up with.
  * Some are utility scripts that anyone can use for deep learning projects.
  * ...etc...
