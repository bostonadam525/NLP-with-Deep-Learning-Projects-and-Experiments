# Tabular Deep Learning
* Tabular deep learning refers to applying deep learning techniques to tabular data, which is structured data organized in rows and columns, like spreadsheets or databases.
* These models, like TabNet, aim to capture complex patterns and dependencies within this structured data using neural networks. 

## What is Tabular Data?
* Tabular data is structured data organized in rows and columns, where each row represents an observation and each column represents a feature or attribute. Examples include customer data in a database, sensor readings, or financial transactions. 

## Why Tabular Deep Learning?
* Traditional machine learning models, like decision trees, often struggle with the complexity of tabular data. Deep learning models, with their ability to learn hierarchical representations, can potentially capture more intricate relationships in this data. 

## Deep Learning Architectures for Tabular Data
1. **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)**
   * These are standard neural networks with multiple layers, suitable for learning non-linear relationships in tabular data. 

2. **TabNet**
   * A deep learning model specifically designed for tabular data, it uses a trainable mask mechanism to select important features and explain predictions. 

3. **Transformers**
   * While originally designed for natural language processing, transformers can also be adapted for tabular data, as seen in models like TabTransformer.
